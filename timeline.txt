[1] Timeline: 100 days

    2016-01-26 - today, UI sprint
        Fixing CSS/HTML layout, buttons/slider function, color selection, fixing rectangle workflow, date entry, timeline navigation, map alignment, ability to change base map, map plotting style/symbols, and transparency options
        Learning Spring Java implementation and working on database integration
        Working on fixing workflow and fixing efficiency in pushing updates to compute engine
    2016-02-03 - UI Review
        Wednesday meeting - UI review with Glenn, set new goals
        Adding new control features and placeholders for unfinished portions of the UI to the implementation
            histograms with additional metrics
            notifications and updates
            errors
        Review what data sets will be accommodated, SSMI, AVHRR
    2016-03-01 - Midpoint design review
        In nearest meeting with Glenn go over all desired functionality and FINALIZE list of outcomes needed by May! [ no additional functionality will be expected ]
        Maintain list of debugging tasks and continue to fix bugs
        Show a working integration between climatology and map overlays - verify accuracy
        Workflow showing simultaneous data sets and comparisons either side-by-side or overlaid
        Address any database changes in Java code base
        Update any portions of the Spring workflow as needed
        Potentially re sample data to allow for speed vs accuracy optimization - high-resolution data vs low-resolution data
    2016-03-15 - halfway point [50 days]
        Begin quantifying performance metrics for speed and data reduction when parsing data - plot how quickly database responds to varying queries
        Potentially accommodate integration of extra data sets into workflow
        Potentially useful feature addition: adding HighCharts plotting would be very helpful! - User clicks on point in map --> corresponding time series data is plotted for nearest lat/lon
    2016-04-01 - Midpoint design review
        Finalize work on eliminating any persistent bugs
        Chronicle a user case flow - following the investigation of a unique example
        Update documentation - Potentially add a sister webpage that explains the system architecture and what is needed to integrate further data sets...
