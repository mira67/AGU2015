Main page content Design, lead by Rudy and Qi

---------------------------------------
Design:
1. Specify parameters
2. In main page map: user specify a rectangle region by click and drag
3. Return query results as markers on the map

Progress:
1. Can draw rectangle, need 
2. Experiment to pop new page after user confirmation, using window.open works
3. Experiment to pass variables tp new page, using localStorage, works

To-Do:
1. See detail in progress to polish, upgrade region selection, add a region selection start button to trigger cross selection cursor
2. After main to 2nd page transition done, start working on the content in 2nd page: using region coordination to query anomaly spatial and temporal informaition and visualize
